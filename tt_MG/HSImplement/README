  - The first argument is the process under consideration given as a string. 
    For the initial state, the allowed choices are p (proton) and pb (antiproton).
    For the final state, the allowed choices are seL-, smuL-, stau1-, snue,
snumu, etc...
  - The second argument is the center-of-mass energy in GeV.
  - The third argument is the pdfset to be used at NLO/NLL. 
    In the case of LO, we do not care. < 1000 = CTEQ; > 1000 = MSTW;
  - The fourth argument is the path to the SLHA input file
  - The fifth argument is a string related to the calculation to perform. The
    allowed choices are "tot" (total cross section), "pt = val" (dsigma/dpt at
    pt = val) and "M = val" (dsigma/dM at M - val). For the moment, only "tot"
    does return a result.
  - The last two arguments are the scale factors. For total cross section, the
    central scales are taken as the average final mass.


Be careful : fortran doesn't differentiate CAPS while C++ does. When calling a Fortran routine in C++, the name must be written in lower caps.
Be careful of the phase space! Some points may be unstable numerically. To test phase space stability, you can try to think about power counting (A ~ m^a: m->10*m -> A->A*10^a), using symmetries of the variables, shift the integrand if possible, change order of propagators...
Use precise phase space points to cross check against external code (be careful of the precision displayed and actual numerical precision).
