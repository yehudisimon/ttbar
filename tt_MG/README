Here is the folder from which we compute and plot p p > t tx for LO and NLO with MadGraph and NLL with our resummation code. The parameters used to run MG5 can be found in the Writecard.py file and ttxprod.sh. Be carefull to use the same parameters (PDF set, M_t, alpha...) in MyCodeResum/inc/Constant.h. For now only CT18NLO (nÂ°14400) PDF set is supported within LHAPDF.

For the plotting routine, we use the step display to have histogram-like plots. The madgraph output for differential cross section is actually an HwU (Histogram with Uncertainties), to get the actual differential cross section one has to display dsigma/dM, dsigma is the value from MG and dM is computed from th first two bins of the MG output (respectively M_left and M_right) for each bin. The binning can be custummed in Writecard.py. For now, the output of MyCodeResum is dsigma/dM^2, so in order to compare them one has to mutiply this output by 2*M. One has to be carefull on those "easy" manipulations when doing merging of bins or add different data. If the MG output is an HwU, the output of the resummation code is just dsigma/dM^2 and M^2. In order to compare and match with the MG results, we take care to choose the M^2 values in the middle of each MG bin.

Ntot = 50, the resummed code uses Ntot+1 to account for this middle choice. M_inf = 2*M_t and M_sup = 5000 GeV. This arbitrary value is taken so that the large M region is not too uncertaint in MG (already 10^-6 lower than the small M region). The bins are originally of equal lenght (linear spacing) before potential merging.
